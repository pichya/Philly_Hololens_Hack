# HoloTrope for Philly Holohack

Using the Holotoolkit Package as a basis for my Hololens Hack project to recreate a Zoetrope animation inside the hololens. Positions individual stop-frame photographs from Edward Muybridges experiments in capturing human and animal locomotion inside a virtual drum. Rotating the drum and setting off a strobe light will activate the animations. The zoetrope was considered a "visual toy" so recreating this inside the 21st equivalent of the visual toy using images captured during the 19th century is quite profound.

Voice commands to play the app:
Start Spin - rotates the photos
Stop Spin - halts the rotation
Strobe On - cues the strobe light to flash on/off
Strobe Off - halts the strobe light flashing
Show Elephant - displays the elephant frames
Show Monkey - displays the monkey frames
Show Cat - displays the cat frames
